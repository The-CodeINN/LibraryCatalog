## Problem Statement: Library Catalog Implementation

You are tasked with creating a library catalog system. Design a class `Book` to represent a book with properties like `Title`, `Author`, `ISBN`, and `NumberOfCopies`. Then, create a class `LibraryCatalog` that contains a list of books and provides functionality to perform the following operations:

1. **Add a new book to the catalog.**
2. **Remove a book from the catalog.**
3. **Display the list of available books.**
4. **Search for a book by title and display its details.**
5. **Check out a book, reducing the number of available copies.**

### Requirements:

#### `Book` Class:

- `Title` (string): the title of the book.
- `Author` (string): the author of the book.
- `ISBN` (string): the unique identifier of the book.
- `NumberOfCopies` (int): the total number of available copies of the book.

#### `LibraryCatalog` Class:

- `void AddBook(Book book)`: adds a book to the catalog.
- `void RemoveBook(string isbn)`: removes a book from the catalog based on its ISBN.
- `void DisplayAvailableBooks()`: displays the list of available books with their titles and authors.
- `void SearchBook(string title)`: searches for a book by title and displays its details (title, author, ISBN, number of available copies).
- `void CheckOutBook(string isbn)`: reduces the number of available copies of a book when checked out.

### Constraints:

- The ISBN is a unique identifier for each book.
- The number of available copies of a book should never be negative.
- Assume that the library catalog will contain a moderate number of books (up to a few thousand).

### Note:

You can encourage the use of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in the solution. The candidate should demonstrate their understanding of creating classes, objects, and methods in C# and how to use them to solve the given problem.
